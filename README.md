### Project: Data Analysis using Kaggle Weather dataset

+ This project provides a set of visualizations and analyses based on weather data from the weather.csv file.
+ The dataset includes variables such as temperatures, rainfall, evaporation, humidity, wind speeds, and cloud cover. The purpose is to explore trends, compare key variables, and generate insights from the data using Python.

### Visualizations Created
- MinTemp and MaxTemp Over Time: Shows how minimum and maximum temperatures vary over the dataset's index.
- Rainfall and Evaporation Comparison: Provides insights into how much rain is falling compared to how much water is evaporating.
- Humidity Levels at 9am vs 3pm: Compares humidity at two different times of day to capture daily fluctuations.
- Wind Speed at 9am vs 3pm: Displays wind speed variations throughout the day.
- Sunshine Hours: Plots the number of sunshine hours over time to understand cloud cover and sunny days.
- Cloud Cover at 9am vs 3pm: Visualizes changes in cloud cover at two different times of day.
